This program is a simple game of rock, paper, scissors where you play against the computer. It keeps track of your wins, losses, and ties, and runs in a loop until you decide to quit. The game starts by asking for your move: rock, paper, scissors, or quit. After you pick a move, the computer randomly selects one, and the program compares the choices to decide the outcomeâ€”win, lose, or tie. Your game stats are updated after each round.
