Bouncing Asterisks Program - Your Roadmap
Objective

Create a fun program where a line of stars (********) bounces left and right on the screen.
What Youâ€™ll Learn

    Variables: How to control the position of the stars.
    Loops: Make the stars move continuously.
    Conditions: Change the direction of the bounce.
    Timing: Slow down the animation to make it smooth.
    Exiting the Program: Safely stop the program when you're done.

Your Steps

    Start Small:
        Write a simple program that prints ******** with some spaces before it.
        Example: ********
        Use a variable to control the number of spaces.

    Add Movement:
        Use a loop to change the number of spaces.
        Make the stars move to the right by increasing the spaces each time the loop runs.

    Bounce Back:
        Add a rule to stop the stars from going off the edge.
        Make them move back to the left when they reach the edge.

    Smooth It Out:
        Add a little delay after each movement using a function that pauses the program for a moment.

    Exit Safely:
        Add a way to stop the program without breaking it. (Hint: Think about how programs handle interruptions like pressing keys.)
