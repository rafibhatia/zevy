A list is where you can store many things like words or numbers all in one place and you can add items to it using append() like my_list.append("aple") Loops like a for loop help you repet actions a set number of times for example for i in range(5): print("This hapens 5 times") You can ask the user for input with input() and show them somthing with print() such as word = input("Enter a word: ") followed by print("You enterd:" word) To check if two things are the same use == like if user_word == correct_word: print("You got it") Lastly the time.sleep() function from the time moduel lets you pause the game for example time.sleep(2) will stop the program for 2 secounds Use these ideas to figuer out how to make the memory game
