In this project, you'll be creating a program that uses a while loop to ask the user for there first and last names repeadedly. The goal is to check if the names are correct based on specific conditions. Using if, elif, and else, your program will give feedback, like weather one name is right or both are wrong. The loop keeps running until the user gets both names correct, at which point it should congradulate them. This is a chance to practice working with loops, user input, and conditions to make a dynamic and interative program.
